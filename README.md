# UDACITY Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree

Projects for my Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree

## Term 1: Foundation of Artificial Intelligence

### Project: Soduko Solver
In this lesson, you'll get taste of the power of Artificial Intelligence by developing an algorithm to solve every Sudoku puzzle. We won't go particularly in depth into the techniques yet, which we'll do in future lessons. For now, enjoy the fun of building your first AI agent and get coding!

### Project: Advanced Game Playing
In this lesson, you'll build a Game-Playing agent that defeats opponents in Isolation. Along the way, you'll learn about advanced Game-Playing techniques such as Iterative Deepening, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax.

### Lab: Simulated Annealing
In this optional exercise you can check your understanding of simulated annealing by implementing the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and using it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.
Additonally, this project is implemented in Scala.

### Project: Classic Planning
Explore how we can use logic and search to plan out complex itineraries. Many of these planning approaches are the same ones used to power Self-Driving Cars!

### Project: Hidden Markov Models
Learn to process sequences and time-series data using Hidden Markov Models.

## Term 2: Deep Learning and Application

### Mini Project: Using Keras to analyze IMDB Movie Data
Predict sentiment (positive/negative) of IMBD reviews with Keras.

### Project: CNN Breed Classifier
Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app. Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
